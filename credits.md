- Abrexus obviously (and his dog!)
- JabbaMonkey for some textures
- Mrofa for some textures
- MarvinKosh for many tips and pointers (namely the "trick" for hidding vanilla things or recipes amongst other things)
- All the modding community that helps me here and there on the forum and both Discord servers ;-) (Skullywag, E, Spoonshortage, etc...)
