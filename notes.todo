Buildings:

    Structure:

General notes :
  ✔ !!! WILL DO !!! I'm strongly wondering if I shouldn't say that this mod have other mods like VG or Cupropanda's Powerless or Simon's Glass mod, etc as dependencies **AND** patching their defs like I do for vanilla's ones. @critical @done (17-06-23 17:40) !!! WILL DO !!!
  - Add negative Cleanliness to buildings where it is appropriate
  - Look at adding the smoking effect from POW to more vanilla buildings
  - Should I use dll's/Assembly files ?
